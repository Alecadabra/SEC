A JavaFX app to walk a directory path and compare all text files to each other, showing similarity
scores.

Text files are files with extensions `.txt`, `.md`, `.java`, `.kt`, or `.cs`. Results are saved
to `results.csv` and files with over 50% similarity are shown in the GUI table. The search can be
stopped at any time.

## Compile & Run

```sh
./gradlew run
```
