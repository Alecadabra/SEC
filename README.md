# Software Engineering Concepts (Curtin University)

Part of my Computer Science degree at Curtin University.

Syllabus:

> This unit covers advanced software architectural and design concepts, including the development of multithreaded design structures, build engineering, the integration of multiple languages into a single application, and the design and implementation of domain specific languages. Emphasis is given both to the practical implementation of these concepts and to the rationales for their use in specific situations.

## [Practical Exercises](Practical%20Exercises)

Weekly worksheet questions with one assessed question per week to demonstrate
that week's course content. I don't provide the worksheets that these are based
on for copyright reasons so they don't make a lot of sense without context.
