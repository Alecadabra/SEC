# Worksheet 1

## Question 1

### (a)

Could compromise the system and cause catastrophic problems on the plane.

No possibility for technical support on a plane.

Plugins could slow down the software.

### (b)

That's terribly time consuming to work off a remote server for large files like
video files. SQL is also not suited to these operations so is going to be
tedious to code, and slow to run.

### (c)

C is missing many of the features that other frameworks/languages include that
make them better suited to a social-media app.

Need to deal with memory management.

### (d)

Runs on Windows only (mostly).

Maybe run it on a web app instead of this framework.

## Question 2

### Stovepipe system

Maintainability is worse. Less friendly when working across services.

### Vendor lock-in

Tied-in to use a vendor's service/platform/system. If they go under or kill the
platform you have to essentially start again.

## Question 4

### Frontend

1. Scriptable web app with a default look that walks users through a survey. (Web app
is platform-independant to accomodate for anyone with a computer and internet
access, scriptability allows agencies to extend the functionality of the site
to accommodate a survey's specific needs).

2. Direct databse entry for agency employees entering paper-based survey
results via Microsoft Access (Government agencies use a standardised Windows
environment).

3. Paper form given to users with no computer access.

4. Survey data access via Microsoft Access (Government agencies use a standardised Windows
environment, Access can apparently do charts).

### Authentication

1. Government username/password authentication system for users on the web app
form.

2. Internal agency employee authentication for agency employees on the
spreadsheet and data access web app.

### Database

Separate database table for each kind of survey. Paper based surveys and
normally filled out surveys are indistinguishable on the database.

### Backend
